"What are the proposed terms for the rate increase according to the CPUC?","The proposed terms for the rate increase according to the CPUC and Governor Gray Davis involve a 15-percent rate hike for the utilities. However, there is speculation that the CPUC will approve an increase for extra costs that will be applied in increments over the course of 2001. This incremental approach could result in an ultimate rate increase somewhere in the range of 15 percent to 30 percent (or more), offering a compromise to both the utilities and the consumers. The utilities will receive a rate increase closer to what they claim is necessary, while utility customers will not face an immediate, all-at-once increase in their electricity bills. Additionally, the CPUC is not expected to approve any back billing that the utilities have demanded.","['. as we wait with anticipation to hear what the cpuc will decide, let is recap some of the issues that will no doubt continue to cause great dissension among the primary players in california. as has been well documented, pgoand sce are in a massive amount of debt due to uncollected costs they have accrued related to the purchase of power on the wholesale market. due to rate freezes still in place, both utilities have been unable to charge customers for the dramatic increase in the price of wholesale power, which has placed them both on the brink of bankruptcy. from several conversations with my contacts in california, here is my understanding of where the negotiations currently stand. the cpuc already has agreed in theory to a rate increase, but the sticking point is the specific amount of that increase. reportedly, the cpuc and gov. gray davis proposed a 15-percent rate hike to the two utilities', '. reportedly, the cpuc and gov. gray davis proposed a 15-percent rate hike to the two utilities. in sharp contrast, pgomaintains that it needs to increase rates by as much as 40 percent, and sce says that it wants an increase of 30 percent (or 76 percent over two years). in fact, pgoalready began notifying customers last week that it wants to boost their electric bills by that specific amount. both utilities continue to argue that even if their proposed rate increases are accepted, they still may not be enough to cover wholesale costs, which are projected to rise through 2003 (see my issuealert from dec. 29). in addition, pgoand sce also claim that their financial solvency still will not be guaranteed even if their rate increase proposals are accepted, and bankruptcy will be very likely if the cpuc only allows them to increase rates by 15 percent. over the last few weeks, pressure was put on the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) to step in and solve the problem', '. davis, a democrat, to keep any rate increase given to the utilities to a minimum. in fact, last week nader stated that davis\' political future ""hangs by a kilowatt hour"" and that any decisions made in california will ""reverberate all over the country."" in essence, consumer groups believe that utilities share the bulk of responsibility for the current mess in the state, as they played a large role in california is 1996 restructuring legislation. if mistakes were made in that legislation, consumer groups say, the utilities and not utility customers should be made to pay the price. speculation is growing that, on jan. 4, the cpuc will approve an increase for extra costs that will be applied in increments over the course of 2001, resulting in an ultimate rate increase that is somewhere in the range of 15 percent to 30 percent (or more). this in effect will offer a compromise to both sides', '. this in effect will offer a compromise to both sides. the utilities will receive a rate increase closer to what they claim is necessary, and utility customers will not get slapped with an immediate, all-at-once increase in their electricity bills. however, the cpuc probably will not approve any back billing that the utilities have also demanded. both pgoand sce have claimed that their stranded costs were probably paid off months ago, meaning that the rate freeze still in place for both utilities should have been lifted as a result. that theory being accurate, both companies want to bill their customers retroactively to the date that the rate freeze should have been lifted, which on its own could amount to several billions of dollars. under the current arrangement, the rate freeze is scheduled to stay in effect until march 2002, unless lifted by the cpuc. meanwhile, the question about the financial solvency of both pgoand sce continues to loom', "". moreo= ver, after consumers' fuel/purchased power adjustment clause is reinstated= , we could reneotiate the contract downwards and pass on a small savings (a= gain, a rate decrease)to customers and we and consumers could split the lio= n is share of the savings revenue. lastly, but more significantly, the mich= igan law that pertains to utilities recovering qf costs through rates only = provides authority to the commission to review ppa changes if the costs for= power and energy increase. our proposed changes are not likely to be deem= ed to be a rate increase. generally an unchanged rate for a service with a= declining quality of service ( e.g., a firm transport service changed to a= n interruptible service at the same rate)could be construed as a rate incre= ase thus triggering the commission is authority""]","A 1 cent/kwh charge for all customers","1","3","1","3","4","0.04","4","-"

"Who from Enron requested flexibility on the payment of the September 30 principal payment for Panther, and why?","The request for flexibility on the payment of the September 30 principal payment for Panther was communicated by an unnamed representative of Enron. The reason for the request was due to the restructuring of the Panther loan, which became necessary after Panther violated certain financial covenants because of a temporary shutdown of coal production at the mine. Despite these covenant violations, all principal and interest payments had been made as scheduled. The representative mentioned that deferring certain principal payments until June 30, 2000, when Panther was expected to resume coal production, was part of the restructuring considerations. Additionally, DPR Holding Company, which was holding $2.0 million for the payment or dividend distributions, requested to wait until the distribution payment date in November to make the principal payment. This would provide more time to finalize the restructuring negotiations and potentially defer the payment until June, allowing DPR to make a larger dividend distribution to both Enron and Chris Cline. The representative clarified that agreeing to this delay did not constitute a waiver or decision to defer the payment.","['. our next meeting will be next wednesday, november 1 in eb38c2. thanks again for the hard work. mark senior counsel, ena phone: 713-345-8897 facsimile: 713-646-3940 e-mail: mark.greenberg@enron.com alan, please confirm that you have told mike that it is required that legal be consulted on such a waiver. mark this memo is being sent to inform you that the september 30 panther principal payment was made today and to clarify the confusion around the delay for the payment. panther is one of the operating subsidiaries in our dpr holding company relationship with chris cline. as many of you are aware, we are in the process of restructuring the panther loan. panther has violated certain financial covenants as a result of the lack of coal production when the mine was temporarily idled. these covenant violations put the loan in default and put us in a position to restructure certain aspects of the relationship.

(all principal and interest payments have been made as scheduled despite the shutdown). part of the restructuring may involve deferring certain principal payments until 6/30/00 when panther is expected to resume coal production. since we are in the process of negotiating certain changes and since dpr holding company was sitting on $2.0 mm to be used for the payment and/or dividend distributions, they asked if they could wait until the distribution payment date in november before making the principal payment. this would give us a few more weeks to finalize the restructuring negotiations and perhaps enable them to defer the payment until june. this would also allow dpr to make a larger dividend distribution to both us and cline. i told them that this was okay but that it did not constitute a waiver or decision to defer the payment. unfortunately, this was not communicated well internally', '.netscape.com. - letter to jim taylor-enron attorneys-10-12-99.doc please disregard to prior version and use this one. tyrell, i am assuming that cannon has not signed the amendment to the letter agreement yet and we can just modify that letter. let me know and i will modify the amendment letter to reflect the new payment date. barry tycholiz@enron 04/21/2001 10:03 am yes, we can make that payment for any date. let is raise a letter amending the payment from 30 days to whatever date he wants. bt attached are the two confirms for the sierra pacific power gas deal with the netting language inserted in the confirms as requested by credit. please review and let me know if you have any questions. christian yoder in portland also reviewed the language. for the sake of completeness attached is the final version of the gas transaction support agreement.

"What is the proposal for reaching a settlement with VEPCO regarding the Real-Time hourly index published by the PJM ISO?","The proposal for reaching a settlement with VEPCO regarding the Real-Time hourly index published by the PJM ISO includes the following key points:

1. **Settlement Basis**: Enron (ENE) aims to settle against the real-time hourly index published by the PJM ISO for the Vepco/Potomac interface, with an additional $5/MWh for delivery.

2. **Flexibility in Delivery Points**: Enron would retain flexibility around the physical delivery points, meaning they can deliver the physical energy at any point identified in the contract.

3. **Call Option Preference**: VEPCO prefers to continue treating this agreement as a call option rather than a firm delivery.

4. **Index Preference**: VEPCO would prefer to settle against the day-ahead index versus the hourly index. They are also open to considering another PJM West index, such as the VAP/Alleghany index.

5. **Alternate Calling Times**: VEPCO is willing to look at alternate times for calling on power if necessary.

6. **Renegotiation Timeline**: Both parties would like to renegotiate the terms by December 1, 2001.

"What reasons did Pacific Gas and Electric Company cite for filing for Chapter 11 reorganization?","Pacific Gas and Electric Company cited several reasons for filing for Chapter 11 reorganization:

1. **Unreimbursed Energy Costs**: The company was facing increasing unreimbursed energy costs, which were growing by more than $300 million per month.

5. **Procurement Responsibility**: The state failed to assume the full procurement responsibility for Pacific Gas and Electric's ""net open position"" as provided under AB1X.

"What is the subject of James Stiglitz's criticism towards the IMF and U.S. Treasury policy?","James Stiglitz's criticism towards the IMF and U.S. Treasury policy centers on several key issues:

1. **Austerity Measures and Social Impact**: Stiglitz criticizes the IMF's imposition of austerity measures, which he argues have led to social unrest and economic instability. He refers to these uprisings as ""IMF riots"" and highlights the ethnic conflict in Indonesia as a consequence of such policies.

2. **Capital Flow Liberalization**: He questions the Treasury and IMF's insistence that emerging nations remove restrictions on capital flows. Stiglitz points out that vulnerability to ""hot money"" can exacerbate economic crises, noting that countries like China have achieved significant growth without fully convertible currencies.

3. **Crash Privatization in Russia**: Stiglitz argues that the rapid privatization in Russia, implemented without a functioning democratic, legal, or financial regulatory system, led to the creation of a corrupt oligarchy that hindered economic growth. He is particularly critical of the IMF's 1998 bailout of Russia, which he claims facilitated capital flight rather than economic stability.

4. **Policy of Conditionality**: Stiglitz objects to the IMF's policy of making loans contingent on extensive internal changes, arguing that these ""conditionalities"" go beyond what is necessary for loan repayment and often worsen the economic situation.

5. **Narrow Economic Models**: He criticizes the narrow economic models used by the Treasury and IMF, which failed to account for potential","['. indeed, austerity-inspired uprisings are routinely called ""imf riots."" but when he raised his doubts, within channels, he says, ""it was like hitting your head against the wall."" stiglitz has other pungent criticisms of the washington consensus: he questions the treasury/imf insistence that emerging nations end restrictions on capital flows. he points out that vulnerability to hot money can worsen crises, emphasizing that some countries, such as china, have achieved significant rates of growth without making their currencies fully convertible. he continues to criticize western policy toward russia. he argues that the crash privatization program, in a country with no working democratic, legal or financial regulatory system, created a corrupt new oligarchy that blocks economic growth. he is particularly biting about the imf is 1998 russian bailout. ""was this a good investment?"" he asks. ""you put in $6 billion ... that enables the oligarchs to take out $6 billion in capital flight the next day', '. ""so you ask yourself the question:  wouldo you remain silent and play the system, or do you speak out?\' why have a job with responsibility if you do not speak out?"" the imf imposed its plan, and just as stiglitz and the world bank had predicted, ethnic conflict swept across indonesia, leaving hundreds dead. by then, however, the economist was speaking out on indonesia and other international economic matters -- an action that earned him the enmity of lawrence summers, now secretary of the treasury, then in a lesser role at the agency, and other officials at the treasury and the imf. their hostility, he asserts, led to his departure from the world bank earlier this year. today, from the outside, stiglitz is increasing his criticism of the u.s. treasury/imf policy toward asia, latin america and russia, which is still fundamentally unchanged despite the great scare of 1997-98. stiglitz himself may not join the expected protests this week in washington at the imf/world bank annual meetings', '... that enables the oligarchs to take out $6 billion in capital flight the next day. clearly the country is worse off, and everybody knew it was going to happen."" he has strong objections to the imf is policy of ""conditionality"" -- of making loans to countries contingent on far-reaching internal changes. ""of course, any lender will need evidence the loan can be repaid,"" he recognizes. ""but the conditionalities the imf imposes have gone well beyond anything required for repayment."" now that stiglitz is outside the system, he is expanding his critique. he will divide his time between the brookings institution in washington, teaching at stanford and working on a book about his experiences on the inside. not surprisingly, he comes down hardest on the u.s. treasury/imf policymakers. they embody what stiglitz calls ""the theory of escalating commitment."" by that he means, ""the cost of continuing mistakes is borne by others, while the cost of admitting mistakes is borne by yourself', '. today, stiglitz still cannot hide his astonishment at these contractionary policies. the washington consensus argued that the measures were necessary to restore overseas investor confidence, stabilize falling exchange rates and attract capital back into the afflicted countries. but he points out that their economic models were far too narrow, and therefore doomed to fail. for example, the treasury/imf strategy ignored the potential for bankruptcies. the sky-high interest rates forced even sound companies in thailand and indonesia to the wall, which was not the best way to re-inspire foreign investors. at the same time, the sharp cuts in government spending stimulated violence across indonesia, which did not build confidence overseas, either. stiglitz insists that ""these political and social concerns are not outside the economic model."" he knew that over the years, unrest had been frequent in the developing world following the imposition of austerity plans', '. he suggested that the united states and the monetary fund had failed to acknowledge that their prescription for russia -- quick privatization of state-owned industries, an end to state oversight of the economy, abolition of price controls and an opening up to the rest of the world -- had not produced the intended results and indeed had left many people worse off. ""stiglitz has been a very strong advocate for the poor and the excluded, and he is been one of the best things in the world bank in the last decade,"" said seth amgott, a spokesman for oxfam, which promotes poverty-fighting policies. ""he is also been very pointed and insightful in discussing the role of the imf. we are not used to that kind of candor."" stiglitz won few friends among economists and policy makers at the treasury department and the monetary fund']","IMF/World Bank policy","NaN","NaN","NaN","5","NaN","0.01","25","-"
"What are the key issues discussed by Vince Kaminski in his communication to Ryan regarding LJM/Raptor-related transactions, and what conditions does he assert are necessary for him to support the valuations produced by his group?","The key issues discussed by Vince Kaminski in his communication to Ryan regarding LJM/Raptor-related transactions revolve around the reliability and accuracy of the valuations produced by his group. Kaminski expresses strong concerns about the inability to support these valuations due to the lack of examination of all related legal documents. He acknowledges that although his group did solid work based on verbal information, this is insufficient for guaranteeing the quality of the final product. Kaminski emphasizes that the transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass the due diligence requirements expected from any professional.

The conditions Kaminski asserts as necessary for him to support the valuations include:

1. **Examination of All Related Legal Documents**: Kaminski insists on the need to review all the legal documents related to the LJM/Raptor transactions. Without this, he cannot guarantee the accuracy of the valuations.

2. **Full Due Diligence**: He stresses that full due diligence is required to ensure the quality and reliability of the valuations. This involves thorough scrutiny and validation of all information, not just relying on verbal communications.

3. **Addressing Complexity and Controversy**: Kaminski highlights the complexity and controversial nature of the transactions, which necessitates a more rigorous approach to valuation.

Without meeting these conditions, Kaminski concludes that he cannot support the valuations produced by his group.","['. i feel strongly that i cannot support the valuations my group has produced so far for the ljm/raptor related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents. i feel that we did solid work based on verbal information, but i cannot guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts. these transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements that you would expect from any professional. vince kaminski vince, i have it. rakesh rakesh, i have informed ryan siurek (cc rick buy) on oct 4 that i cannot sign off on any analysis done by our group without looking at full set of legal documents related to the ljm transactions. those documents were not provided and therefore we cannot sign off on any analysis done in the past. i have come to a conclusion that we cannot support the valuations based on verbal and often conflicting information, without doing full due diligence', '... > > on june 1, 2001 an email was sent regarding vince kaminski...will mr > kaminski be participating in the panel presentation co-authored with > yourself, charles baden-fuller, ian macmillan, and rita mcgrath?

He asserts that due diligence is paramount, given the complexity and controversy surrounding these transactions. He emphasizes that professional expectations necessitate this level of scrutiny before endorsing the final product. 

Kaminski's crucial points are:
1. The importance of thorough examination of legal documents before supporting the valuations.
2. The solid but verbally based work of his group lacking the legal document confirmation.
3. The transactions' complexity and controversy necessitating due diligence.

"Why was there a need to involve key personnel on EES retail risk management and structuring before transitioning to NETCO?","Based on the provided information, there was a need to involve key personnel in EES retail risk management and structuring before transitioning to NETCO for several reasons:

1. **Development of Commodity Skills**: Key personnel were essential to develop commodity skills that did not reside in the wholesale business. This was crucial for promptly and effectively pricing and structuring retail commodity transactions to the delivery point.

2. **Streamlining and Redeployment**: Involving key personnel allowed for the streamlining of the account delivery and management team. Staff could be redeployed to support the development of new business for EES Europe, ensuring that the organization remained efficient and effective.

3. **Effective Account Management**: Key personnel played a vital role in maintaining effective account management, which was a key capability for EES. Their involvement ensured that as deals with customers were closed, staffing needs could be reviewed and adjusted accordingly.

4. **Coordination with Wholesale Business**: It was vital to remain totally coordinated with the wholesale business for price risk management services. Key personnel ensured this coordination, which was necessary for the seamless transition and continued growth of EES.

"What is the overall mood among employees regarding the possibility of illegal transactions and the upcoming employee meeting?","Based on the provided email data, the overall mood among employees regarding the possibility of illegal transactions and the upcoming employee meeting appears to be one of concern and unease. 

1. **Illegal Transactions:**
   - There is a clear indication of worry and suspicion among employees about potential illegal activities. One employee explicitly states, ""I wonder if we really did conduct illegal transactions - at this point - I would believe anything - this sucks."" This shows a heightened level of anxiety and distrust.
   - The mention of ""gifting clubs"" being potentially illegal pyramid schemes and the internal communication about it further adds to the concern about illegal activities within the company.

2. **Upcoming Employee Meeting:**
   - The anticipation of the upcoming employee meeting is marked by a sense of urgency and expectation. The same employee mentions, ""we have an employee meeting tomorrow - everyone is waiting to hear what Lay has to say,"" indicating that employees are eagerly awaiting clarification and information from leadership.
   - This sentiment is compounded by the backdrop of layoffs and negative publicity, which suggests that employees are looking for reassurance and answers from the meeting.

In summary, the mood among employees is a mixture of concern about illegal transactions and a sense of anticipation for the upcoming meeting, hoping it will address their worries and provide some clarity.","['you are dying to do. see you soon! _____ pam macaul information developer 713.918.3938 2.1427a _____ (see attached file: bmc_logo.gif) (see attached file: comp26(1).gif) i guess we know why it tanked now -- i wonder if we really did conduct illegal transactions - at this point - i would believe anything - this sucks -- we have an employee meeting tomorrow - everyone is waiting to here what lay has to say the 14th is much better for me as we already have plans on the 7th the two dates to choose from are december 7 and december 14 both on fridays due to company christmas party conflicts. we have decided to do it at two houses with heavy hors  would vours, dessert and drinks. the progressive dinner format takes too long and this will allow us to actually play with our husbands. please email me your date preference and i will get back with you on the date chosen and i will get back to you with all the other details. i do not think you would really want to be here right now anyway', '.doc - enron risk assessment matrix.doc fyi below find the proposed message that we intend to send to all us employees= =20 regarding the alleged ""gifting clubs."" i wanted you to be aware of the=20 company is position concerning these ""gifting clubs"" in the event that your= =20 staff was to receive any questions concerning this matter. thank you. kriste sullivan eb 4861 ext. 37557 =09kriste sullivan =09sent by: tanja murray =0907/28/2000 06:14 pm =09=09=20 below find a draft of the all employee communication regarding ""gifting=20 clubs."" please provide me with your comments. thank you. =01&the company has become aware that company employees have been solicited= for=20 participation in =01&gifting clubs.=018 these clubs appear to be illegal p= yramid=20 schemes. if you are approached about joining a club but aren=01,t sure if = it=01,s=20 an illegal gifting club, contact the better business bureau', '. in their suits, all filed over the last year or so, employees at microsoft, ford motor and conoco say the rating systems are unfair because they favor some groups of employees over others: white males over blacks and women, younger managers over older ones and foreign citizens over americans. a growing number of companies are turning to grading systems, also known as forced rankings or distributions, as a way of making sure managers evaluate employees honestly and make clearer distinctions among them. at companies that do not compare employees with one another this way, nearly every employee can come away feeling above average, like the children of lake wobegon. but under the grading system, managers are forced to identify some people as low performers. at general electric, for example, supervisors identify the top 20 percent and bottom 10 percent of their managerial and professional employees every year. the bottom 10 percent are not likely to stay. as john f. welch jr', '.

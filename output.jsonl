{"question": "Why does Janet Dietrich express concern about the EES operations in Alberta and Ontario?", "ground_truth_answer": "Janet Dietrich's concern stems from the negative potential net present value (NPV) of the Owens Corning gas and power positions in Alberta and Ontario. Specifically, the sale of gas at AECO Index + Cdn$1.73/GJ is underperforming due to the climbing costs of Nova, TCPL, and LDC demand, commodity, and fuel, resulting in an estimate by Brian Gillis indicating a significant financial loss.

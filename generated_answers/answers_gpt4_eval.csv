What are the proposed terms for the rate increase according to the CPUC?,A 1 cent/kwh charge for all customers,"The proposed terms for the rate increase according to the CPUC and Governor Gray Davis are a 15-percent rate hike for the two utilities, Southern California Edison (SCE) and Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E).","['. as we wait with anticipation to hear what the cpuc will decide, let is recap some of the issues that will no doubt continue to cause great dissension among the primary players in california. as has been well documented, pgoand sce are in a massive amount of debt due to uncollected costs they have accrued related to the purchase of power on the wholesale market. due to rate freezes still in place, both utilities have been unable to charge customers for the dramatic increase in the price of wholesale power, which has placed them both on the brink of bankruptcy. from several conversations with my contacts in california, here is my understanding of where the negotiations currently stand. the cpuc already has agreed in theory to a rate increase, but the sticking point is the specific amount of that increase. reportedly, the cpuc and gov. gray davis proposed a 15-percent rate hike to the two utilities', '.consultrci.com [image] issuealert for january 2, 2001 california hearings continue, cpuc decision expected this week by will mcnamara director, electric industry analysis hearings aimed at giving consumer advocates and utility officials in california the chance to air their views on a looming electricity rate increase are expected to continue through today, setting the stage for a decision by regulators that very well may not please everyone. officials from southern california edison (sce) and pacific gas & electric (pg&e) have asked the california public utilities commission (cpuc) to grant immediate rate hikes of as much as 30 percent to help offset rising wholesale power prices. the cpuc board is expected to announce on jan. 4 how much of a rate hike it will allow, and under what terms. analysis: despite the lull of the holiday week just now completed, the spotlight continues to grow more intense over california is energy market, both throughout the energy industry and across the mainstream media', '. reportedly, the cpuc and gov. gray davis proposed a 15-percent rate hike to the two utilities. in sharp contrast, pgomaintains that it needs to increase rates by as much as 40 percent, and sce says that it wants an increase of 30 percent (or 76 percent over two years). in fact, pgoalready began notifying customers last week that it wants to boost their electric bills by that specific amount. both utilities continue to argue that even if their proposed rate increases are accepted, they still may not be enough to cover wholesale costs, which are projected to rise through 2003 (see my issuealert from dec. 29). in addition, pgoand sce also claim that their financial solvency still will not be guaranteed even if their rate increase proposals are accepted, and bankruptcy will be very likely if the cpuc only allows them to increase rates by 15 percent. over the last few weeks, pressure was put on the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) to step in and solve the problem']"

What is the subject of James Stiglitz's criticism towards the IMF and U.S. Treasury policy?,IMF/World Bank policy,"James Stiglitz criticizes the IMF and U.S. Treasury policy for their ""conditionality"" approach, which imposes far-reaching internal changes on countries as a condition for loans. He argues that these policies are driven by ideology rather than scientific economic models and that they often lead to negative outcomes, such as increased ethnic conflict and economic instability. He also criticizes the policymakers for adhering to the ""theory of escalating commitment,"" where the costs of mistakes are borne by others, while admitting mistakes would cost the policymakers themselves.","['. ""so you ask yourself the question:  wouldo you remain silent and play the system, or do you speak out?\' why have a job with responsibility if you do not speak out?"" the imf imposed its plan, and just as stiglitz and the world bank had predicted, ethnic conflict swept across indonesia, leaving hundreds dead. by then, however, the economist was speaking out on indonesia and other international economic matters -- an action that earned him the enmity of lawrence summers, now secretary of the treasury, then in a lesser role at the agency, and other officials at the treasury and the imf. their hostility, he asserts, led to his departure from the world bank earlier this year. today, from the outside, stiglitz is increasing his criticism of the u.s. treasury/imf policy toward asia, latin america and russia, which is still fundamentally unchanged despite the great scare of 1997-98. stiglitz himself may not join the expected protests this week in washington at the imf/world bank annual meetings', '... that enables the oligarchs to take out $6 billion in capital flight the next day. clearly the country is worse off, and everybody knew it was going to happen."" he has strong objections to the imf is policy of ""conditionality"" -- of making loans to countries contingent on far-reaching internal changes. ""of course, any lender will need evidence the loan can be repaid,"" he recognizes. ""but the conditionalities the imf imposes have gone well beyond anything required for repayment."" now that stiglitz is outside the system, he is expanding his critique. he will divide his time between the brookings institution in washington, teaching at stanford and working on a book about his experiences on the inside. not surprisingly, he comes down hardest on the u.s. treasury/imf policymakers. they embody what stiglitz calls ""the theory of escalating commitment."" by that he means, ""the cost of continuing mistakes is borne by others, while the cost of admitting mistakes is borne by yourself', '."" finally, he asserts, treasury/imf bureaucrats are following the dictates of an ideology, not testing economic models in a scientific way. stiglitz uses the term ""market bolsheviks"" to describe the advisers who helped bring russia to its economic knees in the 1990s -- people who believed fervently in a rigid fundamentalist doctrine and tried to force an entire society to conform to it, just as their central planning predecessors had done back in lenin is day. the economist savors one final irony. imf policy makers never apply their anti-state orthodoxy to their own organization']"

"Who from Enron requested flexibility on the payment of the September 30 principal payment for Panther, and why?",Chris Cline; they requested flexibility to finalize the restructuring negotiations and possibly defer the payment until June.,The request for flexibility on the payment of the September 30 principal payment for Panther was made by someone involved in the restructuring process of the Panther loan. They asked if they could wait until the distribution payment date in November before making the principal payment. This request was made to give a few more weeks to finalize the restructuring negotiations and perhaps enable them to defer the payment until June. This would also allow DPR to make a larger dividend distribution to both Enron and Chris Cline.,"['. our next meeting will be next wednesday, november 1 in eb38c2. thanks again for the hard work. mark senior counsel, ena phone: 713-345-8897 facsimile: 713-646-3940 e-mail: mark.greenberg@enron.com alan, please confirm that you have told mike that it is required that legal be consulted on such a waiver. mark this memo is being sent to inform you that the september 30 panther principal payment was made today and to clarify the confusion around the delay for the payment. panther is one of the operating subsidiaries in our dpr holding company relationship with chris cline. as many of you are aware, we are in the process of restructuring the panther loan. panther has violated certain financial covenants as a result of the lack of coal production when the mine was temporarily idled. these covenant violations put the loan in default and put us in a position to restructure certain aspects of the relationship. (all principal and interest payments have been made as scheduled despite the shutdown)', '. (all principal and interest payments have been made as scheduled despite the shutdown). part of the restructuring may involve deferring certain principal payments until 6/30/00 when panther is expected to resume coal production. since we are in the process of negotiating certain changes and since dpr holding company was sitting on $2.0 mm to be used for the payment and/or dividend distributions, they asked if they could wait until the distribution payment date in november before making the principal payment. this would give us a few more weeks to finalize the restructuring negotiations and perhaps enable them to defer the payment until june. this would also allow dpr to make a larger dividend distribution to both us and cline. i told them that this was okay but that it did not constitute a waiver or decision to defer the payment. unfortunately, this was not communicated well internally', '. we communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit. nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the enron center still further. we just refinanced this past monday. we were going to do a 15 year at 6%, but changed our minds and decided to do the 30 year again, but could only get 6-5/8% (still much better than the 8% we had before). we are still going to pay on it like a 15 year mortgage, but the 30 years gives us flexibility to make the lower payment in case of an emergency. 5.75% sounds really good -- do you have to pay points to get it that low? i like 15 year loans for the interest rate, but like 30 year loans for the flexibility -- it is really a matter of personal choice. that is why we went with the 30 year and will pay like a 15 -- it costs a little more (due to int rate) than a straight 15 year mortgage, but is kind of an insurance policy because you only have to pay the small 30 year payment']"

"What are the key issues discussed by Vince Kaminski in his communication to Ryan regarding LJM/Raptor-related transactions, and what conditions does he assert are necessary for him to support the valuations produced by his group?","Vince Kaminski explains that he and his group have produced valuations for the LJM/Raptor-related transactions based on the verbal information provided during their Wednesday meeting. However, he feels strongly that he cannot support these valuations without first examining all the related legal documents. He asserts that due diligence is paramount, given the complexity and controversy surrounding these transactions. He emphasizes that professional expectations necessitate this level of scrutiny before endorsing the final product. 

Kaminski's crucial points are:
1. The importance of thorough examination of legal documents before supporting the valuations.
2. The solid but verbally based work of his group lacking the legal document confirmation.
3. The transactions' complexity and controversy necessitating due diligence.

Thus, Kaminski underscores the requirement of meticulously scrutinizing legal documents to ensure the quality and accuracy of the valuations.","Vince Kaminski discusses the following key issues in his communication to Ryan regarding LJM/Raptor-related transactions:

3. **Reliance on Verbal Information:** He mentions that the group's work was based on verbal information, which he finds insufficient.
4. **Complexity and Controversy:** He highlights the complexity and controversial nature of the transactions, which necessitate thorough due diligence.

Why does Janet Dietrich express concern about the EES operations in Alberta and Ontario?,"Janet Dietrich's concern stems from the negative potential net present value (NPV) of the Owens Corning gas and power positions in Alberta and Ontario. Specifically, the sale of gas at AECO Index + Cdn$1.73/GJ is underperforming due to the climbing costs of Nova, TCPL, and LDC demand, commodity, and fuel, resulting in an estimate by Brian Gillis indicating a significant financial loss. Additionally, sales of power in the Alberta market at Cdn$28/MWh in a $40 market and in the Ontario market at Cdn$41.33/MWh in a $48 market further contribute to these losses. The net impact of these positions is significantly negative, contrary to EES Houstonâ€™s forecast, which indicated a net gain.","The provided email does not indicate that Janet Dietrich expressed any concerns about the EES operations in Alberta and Ontario.

"What actions are being planned for the mass market customer list in Texas, New York, and Massachusetts?","The proposed actions for the mass market customer list in Texas, New York, and Massachusetts include:
   - Ensuring all contracts are processed and booked appropriately to provide a clean list of contracts with corresponding values.
   - Up-scaling staffing temporarily, estimating that 12 additional people could process the remaining contracts within a week.
   - Booking transactions into RPS through the batch process in a timely manner to prepare for potential buyer acquisitions.

What are the proposed terms for the rate increase according to the CPUC?,A 1 cent/kwh charge for all customers,"According to the information provided, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) has proposed the following terms for the rate increase:

1. **Immediate Rate Increase for Residential Customers**: An immediate hike of 9 percent for residential customers of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PG&E) and Southern California Edison (SCE).

2. **Rate Increase for Business Customers**: Hikes ranging from 7 to 15 percent for various business customers.

The CPUC's proposed rate increases are aimed at addressing the financial difficulties faced by the utilities due to rising wholesale power prices, although these increases are lower than what the utilities had requested.","['. as we wait with anticipation to hear what the cpuc will decide, let is recap some of the issues that will no doubt continue to cause great dissension among the primary players in california. as has been well documented, pgoand sce are in a massive amount of debt due to uncollected costs they have accrued related to the purchase of power on the wholesale market. due to rate freezes still in place, both utilities have been unable to charge customers for the dramatic increase in the price of wholesale power, which has placed them both on the brink of bankruptcy. from several conversations with my contacts in california, here is my understanding of where the negotiations currently stand. the cpuc already has agreed in theory to a rate increase, but the sticking point is the specific amount of that increase. reportedly, the cpuc and gov. gray davis proposed a 15-percent rate hike to the two utilities', '. reportedly, the cpuc and gov. gray davis proposed a 15-percent rate hike to the two utilities. in sharp contrast, pgomaintains that it needs to increase rates by as much as 40 percent, and sce says that it wants an increase of 30 percent (or 76 percent over two years). in fact, pgoalready began notifying customers last week that it wants to boost their electric bills by that specific amount. both utilities continue to argue that even if their proposed rate increases are accepted, they still may not be enough to cover wholesale costs, which are projected to rise through 2003 (see my issuealert from dec. 29). in addition, pgoand sce also claim that their financial solvency still will not be guaranteed even if their rate increase proposals are accepted, and bankruptcy will be very likely if the cpuc only allows them to increase rates by 15 percent. over the last few weeks, pressure was put on the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) to step in and solve the problem', '. davis, a democrat, to keep any rate increase given to the utilities to a minimum. in fact, last week nader stated that davis\' political future ""hangs by a kilowatt hour"" and that any decisions made in california will ""reverberate all over the country."" in essence, consumer groups believe that utilities share the bulk of responsibility for the current mess in the state, as they played a large role in california is 1996 restructuring legislation. if mistakes were made in that legislation, consumer groups say, the utilities and not utility customers should be made to pay the price. speculation is growing that, on jan. 4, the cpuc will approve an increase for extra costs that will be applied in increments over the course of 2001, resulting in an ultimate rate increase that is somewhere in the range of 15 percent to 30 percent (or more). this in effect will offer a compromise to both sides', '. this in effect will offer a compromise to both sides. the utilities will receive a rate increase closer to what they claim is necessary, and utility customers will not get slapped with an immediate, all-at-once increase in their electricity bills. however, the cpuc probably will not approve any back billing that the utilities have also demanded. both pgoand sce have claimed that their stranded costs were probably paid off months ago, meaning that the rate freeze still in place for both utilities should have been lifted as a result. that theory being accurate, both companies want to bill their customers retroactively to the date that the rate freeze should have been lifted, which on its own could amount to several billions of dollars. under the current arrangement, the rate freeze is scheduled to stay in effect until march 2002, unless lifted by the cpuc. meanwhile, the question about the financial solvency of both pgoand sce continues to loom', "". moreo= ver, after consumers' fuel/purchased power adjustment clause is reinstated= , we could reneotiate the contract downwards and pass on a small savings (a= gain, a rate decrease)to customers and we and consumers could split the lio= n is share of the savings revenue. lastly, but more significantly, the mich= igan law that pertains to utilities recovering qf costs through rates only = provides authority to the commission to review ppa changes if the costs for= power and energy increase. our proposed changes are not likely to be

gas & electric (pg&e) have asked the california public utilities commission (cpuc) to grant immediate rate hikes of as much as 30 percent to help offset rising wholesale power prices. the cpuc board

What is the subject of James Stiglitz's criticism towards the IMF and U.S. Treasury policy?,IMF/World Bank policy,"James Stiglitz's criticism towards the IMF and U.S. Treasury policy centers on several key points:

1. **Austerity Measures and Social Unrest**: Stiglitz criticizes the IMF's austerity measures, which he argues have routinely led to social unrest and economic downturns in developing countries. He points out that these policies, often referred to as ""IMF riots,"" have had severe social consequences, such as ethnic conflict in Indonesia.

2. **Conditionality of Loans**: He objects to the IMF's policy of making loans contingent on far-reaching internal changes, which he believes go beyond what is necessary to ensure repayment and often exacerbate economic and social problems.

3. **Capital Flow Liberalization**: Stiglitz questions the insistence on ending restrictions on capital flows, highlighting that vulnerability to ""hot money"" can worsen economic crises. He notes that countries like China have achieved significant growth without making their currencies fully convertible.

4. **Privatization and Economic Mis","['. indeed, austerity-inspired uprisings are routinely called ""imf riots."" but when he raised his doubts, within channels, he says, ""it was like hitting your head against the wall."" stiglitz has other pungent criticisms of the washington consensus: he questions the treasury/imf insistence that emerging nations end restrictions on capital flows. he points out that vulnerability to hot money can worsen crises, emphasizing that some countries, such as china, have achieved significant rates of growth without making their currencies fully convertible. he continues to criticize western policy toward russia. he argues that the crash privatization program, in a country with no working democratic, legal or financial regulatory system, created a corrupt new oligarchy that blocks economic growth. he is particularly biting about the imf is 1998 russian bailout. ""was this a good investment?"" he asks. ""you put in $6 billion ... that enables the oligarchs to take out $6 billion in capital flight the next day', '. ""so you ask yourself the question:  wouldo you remain silent and play the system, or do you speak out?\' why have a job with responsibility if you do not speak out?"" the imf imposed its plan, and just as stiglitz and the world bank had predicted, ethnic conflict swept across indonesia, leaving hundreds dead. by then, however, the economist was speaking out on indonesia and other international economic matters -- an action that earned him the enmity of lawrence summers, now secretary of the treasury, then in a lesser role at the agency, and other officials at the treasury and the imf. their hostility, he asserts, led to his departure from the world bank earlier this year. today, from the outside, stiglitz is increasing his criticism of the u.s. treasury/imf policy toward asia, latin america and russia, which is still fundamentally unchanged despite the great scare of 1997-98. stiglitz himself may not join the expected protests this week in washington at the imf/world bank annual meetings', '... that enables the oligarchs to take out $6 billion in capital flight the next day. clearly the country is worse off, and everybody knew it was going to happen."" he has strong objections to the imf is policy of ""conditionality"" -- of making loans to countries contingent on far-reaching internal changes. ""of course, any lender will need evidence the loan can be repaid,"" he recognizes. ""but the conditionalities the imf imposes have gone well beyond anything required for repayment."" now that stiglitz is outside the system, he is expanding his critique. he will divide his time between the brookings institution in washington, teaching at stanford and working on a book about his experiences on the inside. not surprisingly, he comes down hardest on the u.s. treasury/imf policymakers. they embody what stiglitz calls ""the theory of escalating commitment."" by that he means, ""the cost of continuing mistakes is borne by others, while the cost of admitting mistakes is borne by yourself', '. today, stiglitz still cannot hide his astonishment at these contractionary policies. the washington consensus argued that the measures were necessary to restore overseas investor confidence, stabilize falling exchange rates and attract capital back into the afflicted countries. but he points out that their economic models were far too narrow, and therefore doomed to fail. for example, the treasury/imf strategy ignored the potential for bankruptcies. the sky-high interest rates forced even sound companies in thailand and indonesia to the wall, which was not the best way to re-inspire foreign investors. at the same time, the sharp cuts in government spending stimulated violence across indonesia, which did not build confidence overseas, either. stiglitz insists that ""these political and social concerns are not outside the economic model."" he knew that over the years, unrest had been frequent in the developing world following the imposition of austerity plans', '. he suggested that the united states and the monetary fund had failed to acknowledge that their prescription for russia -- quick privatization of state-owned industries, an end to state oversight of the economy, abolition of price controls and an opening up to the rest of the world -- had not produced the intended results and indeed had left many people worse off. ""stiglitz has been a very strong advocate for the poor and the excluded, and he is been one of the best things in the world bank in the last decade,"" said seth amgott, a spokesman for oxfam, which promotes poverty-fighting policies. ""he is also been very pointed and insightful in discussing the role of the imf. we are not used to that kind of candor."" stiglitz won few friends among economists and policy makers at the treasury department and the monetary fund', '. each day, he got increasingly frustrated as the bank is proposals were overruled by its sister organization, the international monetary fund, influenced strongly by what stiglitz calls the imf is ""largest shareholder,"" the u.s. treasury department. especially frightening to stiglitz was the imf is rescue plan for indonesia, east asia is most populous country after china. the fund directed the indonesian government to cut social spending and raise interest rates, policies designed to draw panicked overseas investors back into the country. but stiglitz argued that sudden cuts, particularly in food and kerosene subsidies, could trigger social unrest in the fragile island nation, and that the violence might take an ugly ethnic turn. the chinese minority there had already started to worry. ""my kids were writing school papers about people who remained silent during the holocaust in europe,"" stiglitz remembered recently', '."" finally, he asserts, treasury/imf bureaucrats are following the dictates of an ideology, not testing economic models in a scientific way. stiglitz uses the term ""market bolsheviks"" to describe the advisers who helped bring russia to its economic knees in the 1990s -- people who believed fervently in a rigid fundamentalist doctrine and tried to force an entire society to conform to it, just as their central planning predecessors had done back in lenin is day. the economist savors one final irony. imf policy makers never apply their anti-state orthodoxy to their own organization', '. imf policy makers never apply their anti-state orthodoxy to their own organization. ""intellectual consistency,"" he says, ""should lead them to ask themselves, \'if we believe that government bureaucrats are always incompetent, then why are we an exception? he points out that the spread of democracy, accountability, good governance and transparency are applauded around the world, at least in theory, and asks: ""is it right for an international organization to be the instrument of political change? those of us who are committed to democracy are very uncomfortable with a bunch of international bureaucrats playing the role of god. sometimes, they may play the role in the right way, but they can also overturn democratically elected governments."" in a sense, joseph stiglitz resembles another economist, who worked for the british treasury and attended the 1919 versailles peace negotiations after the first world war', 'vince shirley crenshaw 04/18/2000 08:00 am vince: if it is allright, i would like to take two days vacation, monday and tuesday april 24 and 25. please let me know. thanks! http://www.cob.ohio-state.edu/fin/journal/jofsites.htm pavel, a follow-up on our discussion concerning the wisdom of imf recommendations for russia. vince vkaminski@aol.com on 04/15/2000 10:14:28 am sound the alarm economist james stiglitz rips washington is ""market bolsheviks"" by james north when the asian economic crisis started to bite deeply, during the second half of 1997, joseph stiglitz recalls that his children were studying the holocaust. each day, he went off to his job as chief economist and no. 3 man at the world bank, where he and his colleagues had come up with a consensus of how to contain the spreading crisis', '."" stiglitz: ""do you remain silent and play the system, or do you speak out?"" take, for instance, the world bank is response as the asian crisis unfolded. after thailand is devaluation in july 1997, the bank started to get data showing that the country is financial crisis was triggering a depression -- a severe downturn that would soon spread to indonesia, south korea and hong kong. to stiglitz, who had earlier been chairman of president clinton is council of economic advisers, the pattern looked familiar. ""i was approaching it much as i would if i were advising the president of the united states, recommending stimulatory policies to counter the decline,"" he remembers. instead, the treasury/imf in tandem overruled the bank and did the precise opposite, directing the beleaguered asian countries, as a condition for getting the bailout emergency loans, to raise interest rates and to reduce government spending, including the all-important food and fuel subsidies']"
What is the best resolution considered to address the issue of old unrecovered cash calls with Reliance and ONGC discussed in the documents?,Arbitration proceeding,"The best resolution considered to address the issue of old unrecovered cash calls with Reliance and ONGC, as discussed in the documents, was to file an arbitration proceeding. This decision was agreed upon during a meeting in India with partners, and it was seen as the only viable solution after other means to resolve the issue had been exhausted. The arbitration notices were finalized and delivered on July 31, 2000, reflecting the non-payment amounts owed by Reliance and ONGC.","['i was in india last week meeting with partners and we all agreed that the best thing to do to move ahead regarding the old unrecovered cash calls (""joint interest billings"") was to file an arbitration proceeding and get an objective third party to settle the issue. as you know, reliance and ongc owe eogil approximately $7.1 and $10.3 million, respectively (including interest on non-payment). the arbitration notices reflected only the non-payment numbers which are $5.8 and $7.3 million for ril and ongc respectively. we finalized the drafting and dated the notices on july 29th and we delivered the official notice during business hours monday july 31, 2000. this was the final step in a very long effort to resolve this issue in other means, but as i noted to the ooc after the june meetings this was the only solution in the end', '. 2, have you seen jewel meeks, she is lost a ton of weight and looks like her old self again. you are welcome my friend............i am glad to know you are still checking your e:mails.

The reason for the request was to allow a few more weeks to finalize the restructuring negotiations and potentially defer the payment until June, which would enable DPR to make a larger dividend distribution to both Enron and Chris Cline.","['. our next meeting will be next wednesday, november 1 in eb38c2. thanks again for the hard work. mark senior counsel, ena phone: 713-345-8897 facsimile: 713-646-3940 e-mail: mark.greenberg@enron.com alan, please confirm that you have told mike that it is required that legal be consulted on such a waiver. mark this memo is being sent to inform you that the september 30 panther principal payment was made today and to clarify the confusion around the delay for the payment. panther is one of the operating subsidiaries in our dpr holding company relationship with chris cline. as many of you are aware, we are in the process of restructuring the panther loan. panther has violated certain financial covenants as a result of the lack of coal production when the mine was temporarily idled. these covenant violations put the loan in default and put us in a position to restructure certain aspects of the relationship.

(all principal and interest payments have been made as scheduled despite the shutdown). part of the restructuring may involve deferring certain principal payments until 6/30/00 when panther is expected to resume coal production. since we are in the process of negotiating certain changes and since dpr holding company was sitting on $2.0 mm to be used for the payment and/or dividend distributions, they asked if they could wait until the distribution payment date in november before making the principal payment. this would give us a few more weeks to finalize the restructuring negotiations and perhaps enable them to defer the payment until june. this would also allow dpr to make a larger dividend distribution to both us and cline. i told them that this was okay but that it did not constitute a waiver or decision to defer the payment. unfortunately, this was not communicated well internally', '.netscape.com. - letter to jim taylor-enron attorneys-10-12-99.doc please disregard to prior version and use this one. tyrell, i am assuming that cannon has not signed the amendment to the letter agreement yet and we can just modify that letter. let me know and i will modify the amendment letter to reflect the new payment date. barry tycholiz@enron 04/21/2001 10:03 am yes, we can make that payment for any date. let is raise a letter amending the payment from 30 days to whatever date he wants. bt attached are the two confirms for the sierra pacific power gas deal with the netting language inserted in the confirms as requested by credit. please review and let me know if you have any questions. christian yoder in portland also reviewed the language. for the sake of completeness attached is the final version of the gas transaction support agreement.

What are the key details about GS's valuation of ENE shares?,"In one of the documents, it is mentioned that Goldman Sachs (GS) is going to issue a report valuing Enron (ENE) shares at $68 each. This valuation seems significant as it mentions a specific price target which potentially reflects GS's analysis and outlook on Enronâ€™s market performance.","The key details about Goldman Sachs' (GS) valuation of Enron (ENE) shares are as follows:

1. **Net Asset Value (NAV) Estimate**:
   - Merrill Lynch performed a NAV analysis of Enron.
   - Including off-balance sheet financing that Merrill Lynch was aware of, they arrived at a NAV estimate in the range of $16 to $24 per share.
   - This estimate is considered conservative because it does not include the cash balance or the current net trading position.

2. **Future Valuation Potential**:
   - Merrill Lynch believes that once the situation stabilizes and credibility begins to return, Enron will ultimately return to a more traditional valuation.
   - By employing a discounted price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 13-15x on the firm's 2002 estimated earnings of $1.90 to $2.10 per share, they produce a valuation range of $24.70 to $31.50 per share.

"What are the key issues discussed by Vince Kaminski in his communication to Ryan regarding LJM/Raptor-related transactions, and what conditions does he assert are necessary for him to support the valuations produced by his group?","Vince Kaminski explains that he and his group have produced valuations for the LJM/Raptor-related transactions based on the verbal information provided during their Wednesday meeting. However, he feels strongly that he cannot support these valuations without first examining all the related legal documents. He asserts that due diligence is paramount, given the complexity and controversy surrounding these transactions. He emphasizes that professional expectations necessitate this level of scrutiny before endorsing the final product. 

Kaminski's crucial points are:
1. The importance of thorough examination of legal documents before supporting the valuations.
2. The solid but verbally based work of his group lacking the legal document confirmation.
3. The transactions' complexity and controversy necessitating due diligence.

Thus, Kaminski underscores the requirement of meticulously scrutinizing legal documents to ensure the quality and accuracy of the valuations.","In his communications to Ryan Siurek regarding the LJM/Raptor-related transactions, Vince Kaminski discusses several key issues and asserts specific conditions necessary for him to support the valuations produced by his group:

1. **Lack of Legal Document Examination**: Kaminski emphasizes that he cannot support the valuations without examining all the related legal documents. He stresses that the work done so far was based on verbal information, which he considers insufficient for guaranteeing the quality of the final product.

2. **Complexity and Controversy of Transactions**: He points out that the transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements. This complexity necessitates a thorough review of all legal documentation.

3. **Due Diligence Requirements**: Kaminski insists on the importance of due diligence, which he describes as a professional standard that should not be ignored. He believes that bypassing this step would undermine the reliability of the analysis.

4. **Conflicting Information**: He mentions that the verbal information received","['. i feel strongly that i cannot support the valuations my group has produced so far for the ljm/raptor related

Why does Janet Dietrich express concern about the EES operations in Alberta and Ontario?,"Janet Dietrich's concern stems from the negative potential net present value (NPV) of the Owens Corning gas and power positions in Alberta and Ontario. Specifically, the sale of gas at AECO Index + Cdn$1.73/GJ is underperforming due to the climbing costs of Nova, TCPL, and LDC demand, commodity, and fuel, resulting in an estimate by Brian Gillis indicating a significant financial loss. Additionally, sales of power in the Alberta market at Cdn$28/MWh in a $40 market and in the Ontario market at Cdn$41.33/MWh in a $48 market further contribute to these losses. The net impact of these positions is significantly negative, contrary to EES Houstonâ€™s forecast, which indicated a net gain.","Janet Dietrich's concerns about EES operations in Alberta and Ontario stem from several factors related to the focus and regulatory aspects of the business initiatives in these regions. Specifically:

1. **Shift in Business Focus**: The focus of EES's business initiatives in Canada appears to be shifting more towards Alberta rather than Ontario. This change in focus may require different strategic and operational approaches.

2. **Regulatory Proceedings and Market Design Issues**: Donahue Ernst & Young is already involved in regulatory proceedings and market design issues affecting the Alberta gas and power markets. Their familiarity with these regulatory and licensing requirements makes them a valuable asset for EES operations in Alberta.

3. **Limited Involvement of Blakes**: Blakes, a partner firm in Toronto, has had relatively limited involvement with EES Canada. Given the increased focus on Alberta, it might be more efficient and effective to continue with Donahue Ernst & Young, who are already handling regulatory matters in Alberta.

4. **","['. these folks would continue to work on esa is projects but would get the resources and support of the centralized body particularily in their negotiations with outside vendors including

Why was there a need to involve key personnel on EES retail risk management and structuring before transitioning to NETCO?,"Key personnel on EES retail risk management and structuring are crucial to discharge EES's retail risk contracts responsibly. Ensuring these personnel complete their obligations will allow for proper valuation and orderly termination or sale of the contracts, maximizing value for the estate. Their involvement is necessary to maintain continuity and mitigate any potential disruptions during the transition to NETCO, expected to take approximately four weeks.

These answers provide a comprehensive understanding of the discussions and actions being undertaken to manage financial and operational challenges within EES and associated entities, ensuring a strategic transition through the restructuring process.","The need to involve key personnel on EES retail risk management and structuring before transitioning to NETCO was driven by the necessity to ensure that all EES retail risk contracts were valued and discharged (either through termination or sale) in an orderly fashion that maximized value to the estate. This involved critical tasks that required the expertise and oversight of personnel such as Rogers Herndon, Dale Furrow, Don Black, Bernie Aucoin, and Edith Cross. The orderly discharge of these duties was essential to maintain the integrity and financial stability of the organization before these key individuals could be transitioned to their new roles within NETCO. This process was expected to take approximately four weeks.","['. whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a

What is the overall mood among employees regarding the possibility of illegal transactions and the upcoming employee meeting?,"The overall mood among employees appears to be one of concern and unease regarding the possibility of illegal transactions, as indicated by phrases such as 'I would believe anything' and 'this sucks'. The upcoming employee meeting is highly anticipated, with a noticeable level of anxiety as 'everyone is waiting to hear what Lay has to say'. Moreover, there is a sense of disillusionment, as seen in statements suggesting that the current environment is not favorable and that Houston is not an appealing place to be. This combination of skepticism, anticipation, and disillusionment highlights a tense atmosphere among the workforce.","The overall mood among employees regarding the possibility of illegal transactions and the upcoming employee meeting appears to be one of concern, uncertainty, and anxiety. There are several indicators of this sentiment in the email excerpts:

1. **Concern about Illegal Transactions**: One employee explicitly mentions, ""i guess we know why it tanked now -- i wonder if we really did conduct illegal transactions - at this point - i would believe anything - this sucks."" This shows a high level of concern and frustration about the potential involvement in illegal activities.

2. **Anxiety about the Upcoming Meeting**: Another employee notes, ""we have an employee meeting tomorrow - everyone is waiting to hear what Lay has to say."" This indicates that there is significant anticipation and anxiety about what will be discussed in the upcoming meeting, particularly in light of the recent events.
